Basic Webpage

So this was an assignment for my web programming 1 class. There were some really specific guidelines, and they must be followed in order to receive a solid grade on this assignment. This hasn't been graded yet, but once it has, I will happily post it here as well. 

Some of the more interesting guidelines for this project were to use the <aside></aside> tags, the <figure></figure> tags, the <figcaption></figcaption> tags, and the <section></section tags. I personally wouldn't use any of those tags on this site if I had to make it again, except for maybe the <section></section> tag. 

Anyways, here is the code that I wrote. Could have layed out the CSS in a much cleaner fashion, but for now, it got the job done (aka finishing the assignment)
