				<p>One of my favorite hobbies is to play and watch soccer. My favorite professional soccer club is Chelsea FC, located in London, England. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of the MLS, simply because the quality of the game is not near the European level (yet hopefully will one day). Regardless, I always welcome a conversation about any of the European leagues - although I may get too passionate when talking about it at times! </p>

				<p>Chelsea FC were the English Premiere League winners last season; however, as of October4, 2015, they stand in 16th place. That is shocking because it is the first time this team has won a title and then moved onto being one of the worst teams in the league. Think about it, they haven't lost any solid players, they are just somehow losing a lot! Regardless of that fact though, real fans are fans that stay by the side of their team no matter what, if they win or if they lose. Hopefully one day Chelsea will pick themselves back up and strive to be the best team in the league again!</p>
