				<p>Hey world! My name is Fred Feyzi, and I am a current junior majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am from Saratoga, California - home of the small city with no street lights! My work interests include building specific devices for third world countries as well as working on cool projects on the side. This past summer, along with three other gentlemen, I built a steady state thermoelectric power generating stove, and that device is now ready to be implemented in third world countries. Very soon, I hope I can land a summer internship working as a software engineer (front-end hopefully) in order to gain some industry experience and learn some things that I have not learned in school. I think that will be super interesting and I can get to see this major play out from a different angle than the classic Academic angle. After some engineering experience however, I envision myself going to law school in order to pursue my dreams of becoming a patent attorney. I am intrigued by what individuals can do when they combine the study of engineering along with some law. Hopefully then I can practice some litigation for a while, and then we will see what happens! Thats a little bit about me and my aspirations.  </p>
